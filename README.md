Rando Calrissian is usually fairly reliable... you ask for a random number, and you get one back.

###Usage

```javascript
// Return a random number with a 7% chance of blowing it
var rando = require('rando-calrissian');
rando();
```

```javascript
// just blow it
var rando = require('rando-calrissian');
rando(100);
```

###Cli

```npm install -g rando-calrissian```

```$ rando```

**WARNING** This could decide last minute it isn't really your friend and sell you out to a Bounty Hunter
